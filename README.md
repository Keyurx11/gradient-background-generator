To use the Gradient Background Generator project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/Keyurx11/gradient-background-generator.git`

Navigate to the project directory:
`cd gradient-background-generator`

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the gradient background generator.

The gradient background generator should now be operational. You can select two colors using the color pickers, and the background of the page will update to show the generated gradient.

You can also enter the hexadecimal values of the colors directly into the input fields.

If you want to make changes to the gradient background generator or add new features, you can do so by editing the `main.js` file. Make sure to test your changes to ensure that they do not break the generator.
